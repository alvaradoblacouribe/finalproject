    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Purpose</h3>
    <p>This page shows some resources that immigrants can use if they run into legal trouble or need help applying for citizenship or a visa.  Not all immigrants are familiar with the American legal system so this page will be able to help them become familiar with the system even if they donâ€™t have any legal problems at the moment, it is useful for future reference.  This page can also show help for people that want to come to the United States legally especially students that want to study on a visa.  This tab can alleviate the struggles of coming into the United States legally.
