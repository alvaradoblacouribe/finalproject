# Immigration Nation 

Immigration Nation is a website designed to help immigrants in the Greater New York City Area. In a span of two weeks, we created a site where recently immigrated immigrants could find legal resources, communicy centers and restaurants, and english classes. We included Google Translate in order to allow immigrants that are not familiar with the English language to use it. 

# The Problem

From trying to reach the land of opportunity to just trying to find the way through an unaccepting society, minorities have always had to depend on themselves to make it in America. In 2015, one quarter of the undocumented immigrants arrested were innocent, and more than half of all U.S. immigrants live in or near poverty. It’s time minorities have the information they need to feel safe in order to live as Americans.

# Mission Statement 

Our main goal is to make the process of integrating into American society as easy as possible while preserving ethnic and cultural ties with one’s mother country. Through this easy-to-use website, we provide information on New York City-centered resources and try to make our information as accessible as possible. In making interaction easier, we hope to see our fellow minorities grow with pride in where they come from while being able to sustain themselves in the new land they find themselves in.

# Resources 

This page shows some resources that immigrants can use if they run into legal trouble or need help applying for citizenship or a visa. Not all immigrants are familiar with the American legal system , therefore this page will be able to help them familiarize themselves with the system. Even if they don’t have any legal problems at the moment, it is useful for future reference. This tab can also alleviate the struggles of coming into the United States legally.

# English Classes 

Immigrants come to the United States in search of a better life. However, they are often unable to obtain the jobs they are capable of due to the language barrier. According to the Public Policy Institute of California, 28% of immigrants in the United States live in households where no one speaks English. This isolation from English speakers makes it harder for immigrants to grow accustomed to the English language. Many immigrants come to the United States with the intention of learning English. Unfortunately, more often than not, they end up being in classes with people from different ethnicities, making it even more challenging for them to learn the new language. Therefore, this page is dedicated to classes where immigrants can learn English in an environment where the people around them speak the same native language, enabling them to reach out to their peers for help and motivate each other.

# Community Centers and Restaurants 

Some immigrants come to the United States and feel left out due to the different culture and language surrounding them. Additionally, the people in the community do not always go out of their way to welcome immigrants due to the stigma that has been associated with them by the current government and society. Therefore, this page offers a map with pinned locations where immigrants can find community centers based on their ethnicity in order to make them feel more comfortable in the new environment. Food is also a large part of a person’s culture and not being able to eat the food from their culture can lead to homesickness. The page also show locations of restaurants that have different ethnic foods so immigrants can have a little taste of home.
