  <!--The Problem-->
  <center> <h2> The Problem</h2>
  <p>
From trying to reach the land of opportunity to just trying to find your way through an unaccepting society, minorities have always had to depend on themselves to make it in America. In 2015, one quarter of the undocumented immigrants arrested were innocent, and more than half of all U.S. immigrants live in or near poverty. It’s time minorities have the information they need to feel safe in order to live as Americans.

  </p>
  <!--The Solution-->
  <br>
<h2> Our Goal</h2>
<p>
  This website focuses on aiding immigrant and citizen minorities in the US by providing accessible resources and information relevant to their ethnicity and citizenship status By offering free legal resources for people not familiar with the American legal process and whom do not speak English, providing maps of communities with similar ethnic interests, offering locations of nearby English classes, as well as showing locations of career and help centers specifically targeted for immigrants and new citizens.
</p>
  <!--The Impact-->
  <br>
<h2> Mission Statement </h2>
<p>
  Our main goal is to make the process of integrating into American society as easy as possible while allowing one to preserve ethnic and cultural ties with one’s mother country. Through this easy-to-use website, we provide information on New York City-centered resources and try to make our information accessible as possible. In making interaction easier, we hope to see our fellow minorities grow with pride in where they come from while being able to sustain themselves in the new land they find themselves in.
